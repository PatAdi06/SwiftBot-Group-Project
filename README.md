# SwiftBot-Group-Project
- DO NOT USE ANY OF THIS CODE IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY COMPLETING THE "CS1704: Group Project" MODULE AT BRUNEL UNIVERSITY. IT WILL BE COUNTED AS ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT AND YOU WILL FAIL THE MODULE

This repository contains the integrated codebase from **Group Project module** at Brunel University London.  
The system brings together multiple tasks from the module utilizing the SwiftBot, a Raspberry Pi–powered robot, allowing for learning about libraries, as well as programming in Java.
If requested by an recruiter, I can show the Flow Charts behind the program, as well as the test cases that were used. If so, please email me ("adipattni@gmail.com") and I will try to respond quickly.

**What I Learned from the Project**
- How to design maintainable code that would be able to be integrated smoothly with other developers' code
- Communicating with other developers, making sure that everything is completed by a deadline
- Approaching a system using logic, utilising Flow Charts to see how the program will act visually and making sure that the logic made sense
- Writing Test Cases for the project, making sure that each result was expected and no errors had occured with the logic

**Key Features of the Project**
- Integrating different code by different developers into one program that can be utilised easily.
- Real-Time QR Code scanning and decrypting
- Conversions into different values without using in-built Java Functions
- Utilising real-world frameworks and programming language (Maven and Java)

**__Technology Utilised:__**
- **Language:** Java  
- **Build Tool:** Maven  
- **IDE Utilised in Development:** Eclipse  
- **Hardware:** SwiftBot
- **Dependencies:** SwiftBot-API-5.1.3.jar
